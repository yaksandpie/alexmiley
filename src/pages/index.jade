  .about-outer
    section#about.about
      section.about-intro So, you're wondering why I'm different.
      section.about-description 
        p I implement design with usability, simplicity, and the user in mind. I specialize in user interface development and user experience with a strong fluency on front-end development. That's not to say that I don't have back-end chops. 
        p Tools and techniques: HTML5 [Slim, Jade, Haml], CSS3 [Sass, SCSS, SMACSS], BEM, Javascript [jQuery, Coffeescript], Ruby on Rails, Node, Grunt, and MORE!

            h3 Education
            p I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science where I focused on the front-end. I fit in some studies on usabiliy and user experience during that time as well. My Master's in Library and Information Science is wonderfully complimentary to computer science. There, I honed my information architecture skills as well as continued my empathy and compassion for the end-user.

            h3 Experience
            p I’ve worked all around the world! I started out working in California and then headed to Germany for a few years. Working with different cultures and with different mindsets has truly added to a well-rounded approach to development.

            p There’s nothing like sitting down and watching someone use something that you've created - This opportunity to refine the project is golden. That, along with all the great things coming from front-end technologies, make this an amazing time to be a front-end developer.

          h3 JobHunt: A Personal Project
          p I always found it challenging while looking for different work to keep track of the various positions that I've applied for and in what state those positions are in (i.e. Did I actually apply? Have I heard back? Did I get an interview?). So, in order to put some order into the job hunt, I created a quick little web app that does that for me. #[a(href="http://hunt-is-on.heroku.com/" target="_blank") JobHunt] is that web app. Built in Ruby on Rails and from scratch. This project put me in the seat as a full-stack dev as I delved into every nook and cranny of Rails.
        .work-item
          h3 FINE Design Group
          p Working at a digital agency has given me more experience than I had originally anticipated. I was able to be lead front-end developer on many projects including, but not limited to, #[a(href="http://www.kimptonhotels.com" target="_blank") Kimpton Hotels], #[a(href="http://www.dcm.com" target="_blank") DCM Ventures] (this project was a back-end as well as front-end challenge for me), and #[a(href="https://www.ste-michelle.com/" target="_blank") Chateau Ste. Michelle]. I worked on a handful of internal projects, such as a repository for designs and slideshows. Working with highly talented designers was immensely useful for me as I learned pixel-perfect development as well as refining my negotiation skills when a design got a bit out of scope.
          p The technologies being used are: Ruby on Rails, Sass (SCSS syntax), and jQuery. I was fortunate enough to develop a BEM-like syntax that is now being used on products called #[a(href="www.wearefine.com/mingle/talking-about-bum/" target="_blank") BUM]. I wrote up a brief description of it on the company #[a(href="www.wearefine.com/mingle/talking-about-bum/" target="_blank") blog].

        .work-item
          h3 PPRO Financial Ltd.
          p I once lived in Munich for a few years. During that time, I worked as a freelancer at PPRO. I was responsible for a few internal applications and the major consumer-facing prepaid credit card sign-up page, #[a(href="http://www.viabuy.com/en/order-card" target="_blank") Viabuy]. I had to work with the designer, who created the marketing site, and recreate his vision into the framework we were using for the back-end engineers.
          p The template engine that was being used was Mako using jQuery.

        .work-item
          h3 Experteer GmbH
          p One client in Munich was going through a rebranding and asked me to work their #[a(href="http://eu.experteer.com/about-us/en/contact_us/index.html" target="_blank") About Us] section. This was a straight-forward project with static content. The fun was designing the UI from scratch and have it match the rebranding from the rest of the site.

        .work-item
          h3 CHIP Xonio Online GmbH
          p Also in Munich, I was able to work as a User Experience Developer for the popular #[a(href="http://www.chip.de" target="_blank") Chip.de]. Their UI team was growing and needed freelance support. I was able to take the lead and design/implement the new #[a(href="http://suche.chip.de/?q=iphone" target="_blank") Search page]. I assisted in numerous usability tests and helped in various other places in #[a(href="http://www.chip.de" target="_blank") Chip.de].
          p The template engine that was being used was Smarty using jQuery.

        .work-item
          h3 Innovative Interfaces, Inc.
          p My professional career began as a User Interface Engineer. Mainly, I helped support the UI on the #[a(href="http://encoreforlibraries.com/" target="_blank") Encore] (a library catalog search/discovery system) product in a 3-5 person team. I became the UI Engineer lead for a product called #[a(href="http://www.iii.com/products/reporter.shtml" target="_blank") Reporter] (an internal application used by libraries to analyze statistics). As a team, we initiated the company's first usability tests on Encore, which was awesome!
          p The framework that was being used was Tapestry 4.1 using Dojo. Also, the occasional splash of JSP was needed to understand some other products.
